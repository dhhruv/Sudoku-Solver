- Are you ready to put your logical thinking and reasoning skills to the test? Look no further than Sudoku Solver, the ultimate tool for solving Sudoku puzzles quickly and easily.

- Sudoku is a popular number-placement puzzle game that requires players to fill a nine-by-nine grid with digits so that each row, column, and 3x3 section contains numbers between 1 and 9, with each number used once and only once in each section. It's a challenging game that helps improve concentration, memory, and cognitive abilities.

- With Sudoku Solver, you don't have to spend hours solving puzzles by hand. Our powerful algorithm solves almost any Sudoku puzzle in seconds, allowing you to move on to more challenging puzzles quickly. Plus, our visualizer feature demonstrates how the backtracking algorithm works, so you can understand the logic behind each solution.

## Features:
- Generates a random, solvable Sudoku board every time the script is executed
- Easy-to-use GUI for inputting and solving puzzles
- Visualizer feature demonstrates how the backtracking algorithm works
- Option to receive hints for tricky puzzles
